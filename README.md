# buttercup-server
This repo has the buttercup server client

It provides an interface between the API and the file interface abstraction used by buttercup core. The file interface abstraction is used to call similar function for different kinds of vaults such as a GoogleDrive vault, a DropBox vault, etc. In this case, the buttercup server client implements a Tide Database vault.
